Shubham Mirg is a doctoral candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Penn State, working in Dr. Sri-Rajasekhar Kothapalli’s lab. Their research focuses on developing transparent ultrasound transducer (TUT) platforms for simultaneous ultrasound stimulation and multimodal neuroimaging. Additionally, their work also include building multimolal optical, photoacoustic and ultrafast ultrasound neuroimaging for deriving multiparametric neuronal and hemodynamic information in rodent brain. Shubham’s work bridges device fabrication, imaging system development, and in vivo neuroscience applications, with an emphasis on understanding ultrasound brain stimulation, neurovascular coupling and cerebrovascular function.

They are a Cross-Disciplinary Neural Engineering (CDNE) T32 Fellow funded by the NIH (T32NS115667) and have been recognized with multiple awards, including the Gordon Research Conference Best Poster Award (2024), Freiburg Rising Star Fellowship (2024), and John C. and Joanne H. Villforth Graduate Scholarship. Prior to Penn State, Shubham completed an M.S.(Research) in Photonics at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and a B.E. in Electronics and Communications Engineering at the University of Delhi.

Shubham’s broader research interests span ultrasound neuromodulation, functional ultrasound imaging, ultrasound localization microscopy, multimodal imaging platforms, and photoacoustic imaging for neuroscience and clinical translation.
